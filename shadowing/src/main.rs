//Shadowing is when you declare a variable with the same name as a previous variable. 
//This is useful when you want to change the type of a variable or reassign a variable.
//shadowing is different from marking a variable as mut, because weâ€™ll get a compile-time error if we forget to reassign the variable.

    // can't change the type of a variable with mut.
